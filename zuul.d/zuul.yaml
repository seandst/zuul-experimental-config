      Triggered on PR opened or labeled, used to check if a PR should be
      tested by zuul, as determined by the job run. Only reports success,
      so the check-test playbook can fail and not result in a failing
      check being added to a PR. A success result or adding the "zuul:check"
      label will allow further zuul automation to run on this pull request.
